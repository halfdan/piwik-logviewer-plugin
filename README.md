# Piwik LogViewer Plugin

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will allow the superuser to view log data written to the database by Piwik.

Database logging was largely un-used and not stable in Piwik prior to version 1.11. Piwik 1.11 contains several fixes regarding database logging and is the minimum required version for the LogViewer plugin (although it will run in any version of Piwik 1.x). 

**Note:** Database logging can have an impact on performance of your Piwik installation. This plugin is useful in cases where you want to debug errors/exceptions in a running Piwik installation. It is recommended to activate database logging on production installations only for exceptions and errors.
